                            Baby, looking at this photo makes me remember when we first met on Snapchat. That day, 18th
                            May 2025 when our friendship started - it changed my whole world. Your smile in this photo,
                            that's what made me fall for you first. That smile that makes everything better, that smile
                            I can't stop thinking about. I know I don't give you enough time, and I know we don't talk
                            as much as we should, but you still treat me like I'm the most important person. Your
                            understanding means everything to me. You're so beautiful, and I'm the luckiest guy to have
                            you. ❤️

                            we became official - that's the day my life really started. You're so gorgeous, and I love
                            it when you copy my style. It makes me feel so special that you want to be like me. Your
                            smile, that smile of yours, it's everything to me. Even when we broke up, I couldn't stop
                            thinking about you. When I reached out again and you were mad at me, I knew I had to fix
                            things because I can't live without you. You're irreplaceable. Your smile lights up my whole

                            together, you showed me what real understanding is. I know I don't give you enough time, but
                            you never make me feel bad about it. You're so patient with me, so kind, so understanding -
                            that's what makes you perfect. When you call me "mera bacha", my whole heart just melts.
                            Those words mean everything to me. You're my everything, and I can't even explain how much

                            seeing your photos makes me realize how lucky I am to have you back. After I said sorry and
                            you forgave me, we became even stronger. The way you understand me, the way you accept all
